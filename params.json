See browser support on zepto.js website http://zeptojs.com/\r\n * Responsibility of what you do with this shell\r\n \r\n## Installation :\r\nDownload jak3fr0z.php (default password : jak3fr0z), edit and change password and upload jak3fr0z.php to your server, password is in sha1(md5()) format. Or create your own jak3froz.php, explained below\r\n\r\n## Customize :\r\nAfter finished doing editing with files, upload jak3fr0z.php, base, module, theme and all files inside it to a server\r\n\r\nUsing Web Browser :\r\n\r\nOpen index.php in your browser, quick run will only run the shell. Use packer to pack all files into single PHP file. Set all the options available and the output file will be in the same directory as jak3fr0z.php\r\n\r\nUsing Terminal :\r\n```\r\n$ php -f index.php\r\njak3fr0z shell packer 1.4.3\r\n\r\noptions :\r\n        -o filename                             save as filename\r\n        -p password                             protect with password\r\n        -t theme                                theme to use\r\n        -m modules                              modules to pack separated by comma\r\n        -s                                      strip comments and whitespaces\r\n        -b                                      encode with base64\r\n        -z [no|gzdeflate|gzencode|gzcompress]   compression (use only with -b)\r\n        -c [0-9]                                level of compression\r\n        -l                                      list available modules\r\n        -k                                      list available themes\r\n```\r\nexample :\r\n```\r\n$ php -f index.php -- -o jak3fr0z.php -p myPassword -s -b -z gzcompress -c 9\r\n```\r\nDon't forget to delete index.php, base, module, theme and all files inside it after you finished. Because it is not protected with password so it can be a security threat to your server\r\n\r\n\r\n[Source Code](https://github.com/PhilCodeEx/jak3fr0z)\r\n[HOME](http://jak3fr0z.iwiin.com/)\r\n\r\n### **`Anonymous Philippines`**\r\n                                          2016",
